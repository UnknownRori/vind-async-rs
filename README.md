# vind-async

A fun lighweight runtime for writing weird asynchronous applications, it's still on low level,
it's doesn't have any built in stuff like [tokio](https://crates.io/crates/tokio) or [async-std](https://crates.io/crates/async-std) do

## Example

```rust
async fn hi() {
    println!("Hi!");
}

#[vind_async::main]
async main() {
    println!("Hello Async!");
    hi().await;
}
```
